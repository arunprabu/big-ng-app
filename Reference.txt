Routing 
====
  * let's make sure our app is becoming SPA with 5 characteristics 

  Single Page App
  ---
    Characteristics 
    --------------- 
      1. Pages should NOT Reload between link clicks [DONE]
      2. URL Should change [DONE]
      3. Browser History should be maintained w/o page refresh [DONE]
      4. Header and Footer should not be loaded again and again [DONE]
      5. The Section in between header and footer should show contextual updates [DONE]

  Step 1: Identify the Menus and URLs
    Home                  /
    Concepts              /concepts
    Employee Manager      /employee-manager
    About                 /about
  
    Let's setup these urls in the menus
    
  Step 2: 
    Check the app. Urls are not stable.

    Figure out what component should appear when the users hitting the urls. 

    Home                  /                                 HomeComponent
    Concepts              /concepts                         ConceptsComponent
    Employee Manager      /employee-manager                 EmployeeManagerComponent
    About                 /about                            AboutComponent

    Let's create the necessary components

    ng g c home --inline-template --inline-style
    ng g c concepts --inline-style
    ng g c employees --inline-style 
    ng g c about --inline-template --inline-style

  Step 3: 
    Now, we can configure routes. 

    in app.routes.ts let's do. 


      // Configuring the routes
      export const routes: Routes = [
        { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
        { path: 'concepts', component: ConceptsComponent },
        { path: 'employee-manager', component: EmployeesComponent },
        { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
      ];


  Step 4: 
    Check the app. URLs will be stable. 
    But, the components are not showing up when you hit the menu 

    Let's fix it with router-outlet in app.component.html 

  Step 5: 
    Check the app. Page will refresh. Let's fix it 

    go to header.component.html, 
    replace all href with routerLink 

    to make it work, you need to import RouterModule in header.component.ts 


      @Component({
        selector: 'app-header',
        standalone: true,
        imports: [RouterModule],    // <=== this line 
        templateUrl: './header.component.html',
        styleUrl: './header.component.css'
      })
      export class HeaderComponent {

      }


  Step 6: 
  === 

    Check the app. it works fine.

    TODO: set the page title 
  

Data Binding 
===
  * Keeping the data in Component TS and displaying it in Component HTML 

  1. Interpolation 
        TS ==> HTML InnerText
        {{ }}

  2. Property Binding 
        TS ==> HTML Property
        []

  3. Event Binding 
        TS <== HTML Element 
        ()

  4. Two Way Binding 
        TS <==> HTML 
        [(ngModel)]

        Note: can be implemented in form fields

  5. Custom Property Binding 
  6. Custom Event Binding

Cross Component Communication

  3. Any to Any Component Communication [TODO]
      Prereq: Services, RxJS / Observables, Subscription
